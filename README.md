# Heroes 3 Simulator

Heroes 3 Simulator is a very simple combat simulator for the Heroes of Might and Magic 3 game.

It started with a simple question: how many peasants does it take to defeat an archangel? The answer is 453.

This project is also a sandbox to keep working on Kotlin related technologies.

## Limitations

This simulator has multiple limitations:
- Only one stack of creatures versus one stack of creatures
- No battlefield and no movement, creatures are assumed adjacent and using melee attacks
- No heroes and no magic
- No support of creature skills yet
